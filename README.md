# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This repository contains various sorting algorithms implemented in the C programming language, along with an explanation of their Big O notation.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this repository:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in C and is accompanied by comments explaining the logic and the implementation details.

## Big O Notation

The repository also includes an explanation of the Big O notation for each sorting algorithm. Big O notation is used to describe the worst-case scenario for how an algorithm performs as the size of the input data set increases. Understanding the Big O notation of sorting algorithms is crucial for analyzing their efficiency and performance.
